=============

Import unlocked Kanji and Vocab from WaniKani to a deck in desktop Anki 2.0.x.

Tested on Mac Anki 2.0.8, various WaniKani users/versions/osen.

Now mo' bettah, with a niftier model (contributed by aina @WaniKani)
and a configuration dialog (your truly) such that you don't have to
edit files to set the api key.

INSTALL
=======

Easiest way: download the zip from https://github.com/nigelkerr/wanikani2anki/archive/master.zip which will unpack a folder called "wanikani2anki-master".  There should be some things in the folder.  Drag the items inside the folder to your Anki/addons directory (don't drag the wanikani2anki-master folder itself...).
